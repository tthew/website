				build for the web.</p>
			<p>I like HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript, people and achieving great things with them. I thrive in divese

		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>I'm a seasoned software developer who's been building, designing and leading teams that build for the web for
			over twenty years.</p>
		<p>I have a broad and varied experienced right across the stack, with an emphasis on the front end. Over the
			years I've been exposed to a wide array of patterns, technologies and architechtures, with a heavy focus on
			client-side web application development for startups &amp; NGOs working with componenent based front-end
			libraries &amp; frameworks and paradigms like React &amp; Next.js for a large proportion of the latter part
			of my career.</p>
		<p>I have an adaptable pesonality who's just as comfortable with rolling up my sleeves and gettting my hands
			dirty as I am operating at the strategic and people managment levels or liasing with and facilitating
			stakeholders and clients.</p>
		<p>It's important to me that my work has real purpose beyond pure capatalistic gain and ideally produces a net
			benefit for humankind. I'm particularly interested in and have been privileged enough to have had the
			opportunity to work on a number of projects in the public, global and private health sectors, which is
			something I would love to continue doing.</p>

		<h2>My developer story</h2>
		<p>Starting out building table based layouts and CGI backends as a teenager in the mid nineties, the journey
			ever since has been of continual self-learning, re-learning and iteration.</p>
		<p>Fast forward over two decades later and you can find me building and leading teams that build high quality,
			highly performant, accessible and engaging, web applications and web sites with the web platform first,
			along with the help of other technologies such as React, Zustand, Next.js, Remix, RPC, GrapQL, REST, React
			Query, Astro, Eleventy, Storybook etc.</p>
		<p>I've had a wide exposure to an array of technologies and methodologies over the years, having worked for
			Software Houses, Creative &amp; Digital Agencies, Startups &amp; NGOs as well as running my own small
			businesses.</p>
		<p>I have an eye for detail and an appreciation for aesthetics & try my best to apply design thinking to all
			areas of my work.</p>

		<h2>About this Website</h2>
		<p>This website was hand made by a human (me!). The front-end is a static build, built with <a
				href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> which is in turn hooked up to a <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft
				CMS</a> backend that exposes a GraphQL endpoint that I self host on a Raspberry Pi in my apartment and a
			webhook to trigger re-build & deployment when the data changes.</p>
		<p>You'll be able to read about all the details soon in an upcoming blog post on how I built and architechted
			this site.</p>
